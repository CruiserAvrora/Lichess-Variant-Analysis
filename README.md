# Lichess-Variant-Analysis
Read and analyze variant files from Lichess database

An interesting question:

Why do average-level players lose so many Queen's Gambit Accepted games as black and win so many as white (up to 16% win rate difference on Lichess)?

That win rate difference peaks at \~1500 Elo and reduce to 2% at 2500+ Elo. It also reduce to 14% at 200~400 Elo on Lichess.

This phenomenon seems to happen to other openings and variants as well, but far less severely like QGA. Generally, win rates for sides will still change up to 4% as players' level change.

This project is to investigate them and find some common description for the 'unbalancedness for weaker players'. 

Welcome to play on Lichess, Lichess variants and Pychess to contribute to the database!
